## What will be included ##
+ TEXTURES
* MATERIALS
* ANIMATION TRECS
+ PARTICLES SISTEMS
+ FPS CONTROLLER
+ ENVIROMENT MAP
+ PREFABS
+ 3D MODELS
+ CANVAS
### Limitation ###
+ Textures size no more than 1024px. I hope this made the project easier and helped launch it on a different hardware.
+ You can only use textures as part of a product. And never separately. This condition was established by the manufacturer (s) of the original photo materials from which the textures are made.
# How to use #
Just copy the folders you need into your project. For example, the materials folder and the textures folder. Or prefab and all its components.
