# Old Flying Ship - GODOT Engine 3D Demo Project #

## Oops and goodbye ##
The project did not open in GODOT 3.2.
There are materials, textures and other things for developers.

Used GODOT 3.1.1

# How to use #
Just copy the folders you need into your project. For example, the materials folder and the textures folder. Or prefab and all its components.

General scheme of ways.
